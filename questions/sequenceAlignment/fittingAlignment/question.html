  <p>Consider two DNA sequences $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{ {{params.v}} }$ and $\mathbf{w} = \mathrm{ {{params.w}} }$. </p>
  <p>In this exercise, we will align the two sequences using a score of +1 for a match, -1 for a mismatch, and -1 for a insertion/deletion (i.e.\ a gap penalty of 1).
  We will use three different alignment algorithms. In each case, follow the specific instructions to provide requested information about the dynamic programming table or optimal alignment.</p>
